# Module Project: Intro to React & Components, Props, and States

This project demonstrates my understanding of structuring React components, passing data down the component chain, using
    state to store and update the store listings, and filtering the items by using a basic onChange event handler. 

**A live version of the site can be found at *[Netlify](https://jtking-canyon.netlify.app/)***

This website is built on React and uses basic CSS styling to show a card grid of products and the ability to filter them
    by typing text in an input box in the header. The page will also scroll to the top when clicking the logo.

Project source and assets are in the "src" and "src\assets" folders respectively.

This would be a super fun project to connect to real data. This is all generated data with placeholder images. Making an example
backend to work with this page might be a nice demonstration though there are tools that already provide a fully functional
ecommerce platform.
